        <h2>Hi, I'm David Mizser, and this is my portfolio</h2>
        <p>This portfolio will feature a few leaflets to showcase key design principles within media, as well as principles in typography, web development and an overall retrospective view on my work.</p>

            <h1>Firstly, True/False Film Fest and CARP (Contrast, Alignment, Repetition, and Proximity)</h1>
            <p>True/False Film Fest is a festival dedicated to showcasing fictional films, music, and other vital forms of art that people can share within the community. Bearing that in mind, I have used CARP, the design principle that follows 4 seperate ideas of alignment in text. Contrast, alignment, repetition, and proximity. These are all ideas that are used to create media, and make it aesthetically pleasing, as well as structually logical, and unique.</p>

            <img src="Images/CARP-Contrast.png" alt="carp1">
            <h1>Contrast</h1>   
            <p>This image uses the design principle of contrast. Contrast is when 2 things are strikingly different, often juxtaposing somethign else directly related. This is often used in Media to make content look distuingishable, highlighting elements in a piece of media, or adding a unique flair to the media. </p> 
        </div>
       
        <div class="image-box">
            <img src="Images/CARP-Alignment.png" alt="carp2">
            <h1>Alignment</h1>
            <p>This image is an example of Alignment. Alignment is when text and elements of media are aligned according to an axis. My leaflet does this simply by aligning everything onto the vertical centre axis, from the logo to all the key details.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="image-box">
            <img src="Images/CARP-Repetition.png" alt="carp3">
            <h1>Repetition</h1>
            <p>This is an example of repetition. Repetition, as it's name would suggest is the principle of using repetition to convey a message, establish a style, or to just make people remember your name or slogan, as I have done.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="image-box">
            <img src="Images/CARP-Proximity.png" alt="carp4">
            <h1>Proximity</h1>
            <p>This is an example of proximity. Proximity makes great use of forcing every element of a piece of media close together, but in a neat and organised fashion. This makes the media piece look busier, but also follow a logical and precise order that is easy to follow.</p>

            <h2>HTML</h2>
            <p>Creating the HTML code was the simplest part of designing the website as it was simply laying out the foundations of the website, its general layout, and how much content I would include. A lot of this was organized using DIV classes, a general layout of headers and paragraphs. This allowed me to create the website you are looking at now, as well as include images using the IMG function to show my work, and with paragraphs, I expanded, provided context, and detailed explanations.</p>

            <h2>CSS</h2>
            <p>CSS is the most difficult part of creating a website. Using flexboxes proved to be a very complicated endeavor. I have used several modes of content to teach myself as much as I could learn about CSS, such as the University's content provided in the module, YouTube guides and videos, and asking AI about specific functions (such as asking the AI how flexboxes really work). Another great source of information was the <a href="https://yoksel.github.io/flex-cheatsheet/" target="_blank">Flexbox Cheatsheet</a>, which was super helpful in managing the organization of my website.</p>

        <h1>This is it</h1>
        <h2>Refletion of Work:</h2>
        <p>Creating the work for this portfolio was a long and complicated process. I have had to create several modes of media, using several new modes of tools that I am yet to fully familiarise myself with. I was tasked with the following:<p>
            <li>
                <h3>4x CARP Leaflets</h3>
                <h3>A typography sheet that includes several styles of typograpghy</h3>
                <h3>The creation of a whole new website that is layed out and created to look professional.</h3>
            </li>
        <p>All of these tasks proved challenging as it is something I had not done before. Creating the website was especially difficult as I have personally struggled with the concept of coding and lacked motivation to learn programming languages, let alone learing two. Despite this, I used many sources to learn more and more and tried to create a website that looks professional. This was a long learning curve, as well as a lot of frustrating moments, such as the website never fully fitting within my monitor, or making small grammatical errors, and other small niggles that showed up during the process. Creating the CARP leaflets was a lot easier. They followed 4 simple yet crucial steps in media design, which were; Contrast, Alignment, Repetiton, and Proximity. I tried to follow these in a minimalistic manner, and my posters aim to be simple and of few words to keep the poster uncomplicated. In retrospect the leaflets serve more to showcase design principles than actuallty promote an event.</p>
