# Coursework Website
 This is the website for my courseowork that will be used to display everything I have created.


Throughout the creation of my webstie I have consulted many modes of information to complete this project. A lot of my knowledge came from asking AI, looking up answers on YouTube and Google, and consulting information that is available through Blackboard for students. Questions posed to AI were along the veins of "What function would I need for _____" and what are the available functions within the coding language CSS. 

I have also used othere sources, such as this https://yoksel.github.io/flex-cheatsheet/ (flexbox cheatsheet)
